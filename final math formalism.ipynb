    "The finite element method (FEA/FEM) is a useful numerical method for solving differential equations by subdividing a larger problem into smaller, \"finite elements\" through the process of discretization. This is achieved by creating a mesh of an object with a finite number of points. A system of equations for each finite element can then be assembled to solve for the entire problem.\n",
    "FEM is very common in engineering fields, especially for fields such as structural analysis, heat flow, and fluid dynamics. "

    "#### Step 1\n",
    "The first step in the Galerkin FE method is to construct the weak formulation of this equation.\n",
    "This can be done by multiplying both sides by a test function $v(x)$ that satisfies the following boundary conditions $v(0) = 0$, $v(1) = 0$, such that \n",

    "\n",
    "Note: There is another form of the PDE you can decide to take when using FEM. Using the minimization form when using FEM is called the \"Ritz Method.\" In our case, since we are using the variational/weak form of the PDE with FEM, our method is also known as the \"Galerkin method.\" The weak form is the mostly widely used, although depending on certain assumptions or conditions the original, weak, and minimization forms are identical. \n",
